# Solar System Simulation

## Overview

This project is an interactive solar system simulation that allows users to explore and learn about various celestial bodies in our solar system. The simulation is built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, providing a visually engaging and educational experience.

## Features

- Interactive 3D-like representation of the solar system
- Realistic orbital movements of planets and moons
- Zoom and pan functionality for detailed exploration
- Informative tooltips with facts and key features for each celestial body
- Adjustable animation speed
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the web page
- `solarsystem.js`: The core JavaScript file containing the simulation logic and data
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the simulation and UI elements

## How to Run

1. Ensure all files (`index.html`, `solarsystem.js`, and `styles.css`) are in the same directory.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge recommended).

## Usage Instructions

- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the solar system.
- **Pan**: Click and drag the mouse to move around the solar system.
- **View Information**: Click on any celestial body to display a tooltip with facts and key features.
- **Adjust Speed**: Use the slider at the top of the screen to change the animation speed.
- **Close Tooltip**: Click the "Close" button or click anywhere outside the tooltip to resume the animation.

## Customization

The `solarSystemData` object in `solarsystem.js` contains all the information about the celestial bodies. You can easily add, remove, or modify celestial bodies by editing this object.

## Dependencies

This project uses pure JavaScript and doesn't require any external libraries or frameworks. It does use the 'Space Mono' font from Google Fonts, which is linked in the HTML file.

## Browser Compatibility

This simulation should work in all modern browsers that support HTML5 Canvas. For the best experience, use the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

## Future Improvements

- Add more celestial bodies, including asteroids and comets
- Implement a day/night cycle for planets
- Add options for different view modes (top-down, ecliptic plane, etc.)
- Include more detailed information and possibly link to external resources for each body
